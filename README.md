# Weather_API_Exercise

The purpose of this exercise is to allow customers of the app "PlanMyTrip" to be able to plan a trip based on temperature preference. This exercise was created in a combination of Google Maps and OpenWeatherApp APIs, Jupyter Notebooks and Python, with the packages Pandas, Numpy, and CitiPy.

In the first exercise, a database of possible destinations was randomly created with current weather descriptions implemented into the database.
